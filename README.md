# Economic agents' impact on Real states prices-DSA210 Project proposal                                                                                                    

## Project Question: How Do Economic Agents Change Influence Real Estate Prices and Home-Buying Trends in the USA?

## Project Description
This project aims to analyze and explore the economic agents' impacts (Inflation and interest rates,..) on real estate prices and how that contributes to people's behavior toward buying houses.
I will explore the relationship between these economic factors and real estate prices if it exist or not. The project will leverage historical data on inflation rates (CPI), Federal Funds rates, and housing prices (from sources such as Zillow and FRED) to identify patterns and correlations.
I will use Exploratory analysis on these data sets and modify them. Then, I will continue by creating visualizations in order to illustrate these data sets and their correlation. I will use some statistical and machine learning to delve further into these data sets.
In the end, I will reach a conclusion regarding this relationship's mechanism between them if it exists. The goal is to provide actionable insights into how these economic variables impact home-buying decisions, especially in fluctuating economic conditions.

Economic Agents:
1) Inflation rates (CPI)
2) Interest rates
3) Mortgage Debt Service Payments (MDSP)
4) Stock Market
   
## Research Questions:
1. How do inflation rates (CPI) influence real estate prices in the USA?
2. What is the impact of interest rate changes on the housing market in the USA?
3. Does stock market have a significant correlation with housing market performance?
4. How would the Mortgage Debt Service Payments (MDSP) influence housing market prices?
      
## Motivation: 
1) Real Estate prices have a significant role in our lives and their relationship to economic factors would enhance our understanding of the reason behind these fluctuations in Housing prices.
2) This project would aid the governments to observe whether instrumentalizing the interest rates would have any impacts on inflation and Real Estate prices or not, if so, Then this modification is helpful or not.
3) Understanding this relationship can inform policies and help people make better home-buying decisions

## Hypothesis testing:

 1) Hypothesis for Inflation (CPIAUCSL) and Housing Prices (USSTHPI):

Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant relationship between inflation (CPIAUCSL) and housing prices (USSTHPI).

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant relationship between inflation (CPIAUCSL) and housing prices (USSTHPI).

 2) Hypothesis for Interest Rates (FEDFUNDS) and Housing Prices (USSTHPI):

Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant relationship between interest rates (FEDFUNDS) and housing prices (USSTHPI).

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant relationship between interest rates (FEDFUNDS) and housing prices (USSTHPI).

 3) Hypothesis for Stock Market (Close) and Housing Prices (USSTHPI):

Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant relationship between stock market performance (Close) and housing prices (USSTHPI).

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant relationship between stock market performance (Close) and housing prices (USSTHPI).

 4) Hypothesis for Mortgage Debt Service Payments (MDSP) and Housing Prices (USSTHPI):

Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant relationship between mortgage debt service payments (MDSP) and housing prices (USSTHPI).

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant relationship between mortgage debt service payments (MDSP) and housing prices (USSTHPI).



## Methodology:
1) Data Collection: Various data will be collected and prepared to be processed
2) Data Preprocessing: The data sets will be processed (Clean and getting rid of unuseful data)
3) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilizing different exploratory techniques
4) Visualization: Plenty of visuals will be created regarding all data sets and their relevance
5) Statistical Analysis: Statistical methods will be used to delve into the core of this project
6) Predictive Modeling: Machine Learning techniques will further predict the prices in the future (if it is possible)
7) Conclusion: Data visualization and final report
8) Future work and its limitations (External factors which would contribute to housing market prices like political events)

## Data Collection:
For this project, I will use various data sets regarding this relationship.
Economic factors like inflation and interest rates data sets will be collected from the FRED database which includes this data for a time-specified duration.
The Housing prices & Mortgage Debt will be gathered from FRED and MDSP.
Further data sets may be collected and utilized during data collection regarding economic agents to enhance this project in terms of its understanding of the mechanism.

These datasets will be utilized to be analyzed further:
1) Inflation data (CPI) and interest rate data (FED FUNDS) will be gathered and collected from the FRED database. These datasets are available publicly and have been provided by FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD OF UNITED STATES. This file is gonna be exported in .csv extension in order to be analyzed further.
2) Housing Market Prices will be sourced from Zillow, which provides reliable and comprehensive data on real estate trends in the United States. This file is gonna be exported in .csv extension in order to be analyzed further.
3) Mortgage Debt Service Payments (MDSP) and House Price Index (HPI) data will also be sourced from FRED, which provides detailed datasets on economic indicators. This file is gonna be exported in a .csv extension in order to be analyzed further.
4) The USA stock market will be extracted from Kaggle. This file is gonna be exported in a .csv extension in order to be analyzed further.
