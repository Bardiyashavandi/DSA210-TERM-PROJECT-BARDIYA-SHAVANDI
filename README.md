## Project Question: How Do Inflation and Interest Rate Changes Influence Real Estate Prices and Home-Buying Trends in the USA?

### Project Description
This project aims to analyze and explore the economics agents impacts (Infaltion and interest rates) on real estate prices and how would that contribute to people's behavior towards buying houses.
I will explore the relationship between these economic factors with real estate prices if it exist or not. The project will leverage historical data on inflation rates (CPI), Federal Funds rates, and housing prices (from sources such as Zillow and FRED) to identify patterns and correlations.
I will use Exploratory enalysis on these data sets and modify them. Then, I will continue by creating visualization in order to illustrate these data sets and their correlation. I will use some statistical and machine learning to delve further into these data sets.
In the end, I will reach to a conclusion regarding this relationship's mechanism between them if it exists.The goal is to provide actionable insights into how these economic variables impact home-buying decisions, especially in fluctuating economic conditions.

#### Motivation: 
1) The Real Estate prices has an improtant and significant role in our life and its relationship to economic factors would enhance our understand about the reason behind these fluctuaions in Housing prices.
2) This project would aid the governments to observe whether instrumentalizing the interst rates would have any impacts on inflation and Real Estate prices or not, if so, Then this modification is helpful or not.
3) Understanding this relationship can inform policies and help people make better home-buying decisions

##### Methodology:
1) Various data will be collected and be prepared to be processed
2) The data sets will be processed (Clean and getting rid of unuseful data)
3) Utilizing different explotary techniques
4) Plenty of visuals will be created regarding all data sets and their relevance
5) Statistical methods will be used to delve into the core of this project
6) Machine Learning techniques will further predict the prices in the future (if it is possible)
7) Data visualization and final report
8) Future work and its limitaion

###### Data Collection
For this project, I will use various and plenty of data sets regarding this relationship.
Economic factors like inflation and interest rates data sets will be collected from FRED data base which includes this data for time-specified duration.
I will use google trends for house buying in USA to comprehend the People's behavior towards house-purchasing in different times in histoty. This data set will be collected from Google Trends Platform.
The Housing prices & Mortgage Debt will be gathered from FRED and MDSP.
The further data sets may be collected and utilized druing data collection regarding economic agents to enhance this project in terms of its understanding the mechanism.

These datasets will be utilized to be analyzed further:
1) Inflation data (CPI) and interest rate data (FEDFUNDS) will be gathered and collected from FRED database. These datasets are available publicly and had been provided by FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD OF UNITED STATES. This file is gonna be exported in .csv extension in order to be analyed further.
2) Housing Market Prices will be sourced from Zillow, which provides reliable and comprehensive data on real estate trends in United States. This file is gonna be exported in .csv extension in order to be analyed further.
3) Google Trends data will be collected for search interest in home-buying using Googleâ€™s trend platform. This data can be extracted manually from Google Trends for specific keywords. This file is gonna be exported in a .csv extension in order to be analyed further.
4) Mortgage Debt Service Payments (MDSP) and House Price Index (HPI) data will also be sourced from FRED, which provides detailed datasets on economic indicators. This file is gonna be exported in .csv extension in order to be analyed further.
5) Other data sets will be collected from Kaggle.com
